**arrangeit** is a cross-platform desktop utility that helps you placing your
desktop's open windows. It is a utility mostly based on the mouse movements, with
some keyboard shortcuts as helpers.


Installation
============

executable inside it.


Source distribution
-------------------

You'll find a detailed explanation in the installation_ and development_ pages.

Use the following commands in Ubuntu for a quick start:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev git gcc libgirepository1.0-dev \
      libcairo2-dev pkg-config gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-wnck-3.0

  $ cd ~/projects
  $ git clone https://github.com/ipaleka/arrangeit.git
  $ mkdir venvs
  $ python3 -m venv venvs/arrangeit
  $ source venvs/arrangeit

  (arrangeit) $ cd arrangeit
  (arrangeit) $ python -m pip install -r requirements/linux.txt

  (arrangeit) $ python -m arrangeit


Basic usage
===========

Move your mouse to set the future position of the window. You may change the active
corner either manually, by pressing the **Ctrl** key on your keyboard, or dynamically
through the snapping functionality (when a moving window snaps to some window with a
side not connected to the currently active corner).

By pressing the left mouse button (or by pressing the **Enter** key on your keyboard)
you set the future position of the window and moving the mouse afterward resizes the
main window. Press the left mouse button again to confirm the future size.

To move the current window on another workspace you should press the wanted workspace
number on your keyboard. As an alternative, you may first release the mouse by
clicking the middle mouse button or by pressing the **Shift** key on keyboard, and
then click the wanted workspace box with your mouse.

Click a window title in the listed windows area to start operating from some other
window.

Click |minimize| (or |restore|) icon inside the title box to change the minimized
state of the current window.

Click |fixed| (or |resizable|) icon if you want to change just the position of the
current window, without changing its size (and vice versa).

**arrangeit v0.3alpha** stops running either when all the windows are exhausted or
when you press the **Esc** key on your keyboard.
