Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

Enter
^^^^^

Confirms position or size - acts identically as left mouse click.


Space | Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^

Skips current window - just like the right mouse click does.


Ubuntu
""""""



If a window is pinned (visible in all workspaces) then if you change workspace during positioning you will unpin that window and so make it visible in the selected workspace only.
