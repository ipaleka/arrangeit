**arrangeit** is a cross-platform desktop utility that helps you placing your
desktop's open windows. It is a utility mostly based on the mouse movements, with
some keyboard shortcuts as helpers.

It should be possible to run **arrangeit v0.3alpha** under X Windows in
GNU/Linux (Wayland is not supported. Yet...) and under MS Windows.

Mac OS X support is expected in the next **v0.4beta** release.
