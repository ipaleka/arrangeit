**arrangeit** is a cross-platform desktop utility that helps you placing your
desktop's open windows. It is a utility mostly based on the mouse movements, with
some keyboard shortcuts as helpers.

Version 0.91 was the last published version of a `Win95/98 desktop utility`_ named
ArrangeIt. Twenty years later, new software with the name **arrangeit** is born.
It has been developed from the scratch in Python and the initial public release
v0.3alpha is now `available to download`_ from the Github. Please bear in mind that
this version is alpha software and it's not suitable for production.

It should be possible to run **arrangeit v0.3alpha** under X Windows in
GNU/Linux (Wayland is not supported. Yet...) and under MS Windows.

Mac OS X support is expected in the next **v0.4beta** release.
